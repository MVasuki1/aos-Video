Eliminate  sponsor link causing application rejection. Link was only visible for sideloaded apk but not for GooglePlay installation. Google refuses to check this point.
Remove application name translation. Google test translates Czech and Portuguese "nova video player" back to English to "new video player" causing rejection. Other applications like "nova launcher" do not face such issue.
Reformat trakt login dialog to keep track of watched videos: it causes rejection without reason provided
